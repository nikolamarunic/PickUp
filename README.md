# PickUp
An app for creating impromptu events, inspired by pickup sports.

Created for Hack the Valley IV by Faaris, Saqib, Niko and Leo. PickUp allows people to place event pins on a map (for something like a pickup baskeyball game, lunch friend, or even something like a study buddy).

People looking at the map can mark that they are on their way and when in range will be marked as in the 'lobby' of the event by geofences for other users to see.

Makes use of the Radar.io and google maps APIs.
